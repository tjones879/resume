    \section{\mysidestyle Work\\Experience}

    \textbf{FFmpeg} \vspace{2mm}\\\vspace{1mm}%
    \textsl{Vorbis Encoder} \hfill \textbf{Feb 2017 -- August 2017}\\
    Improved the encoding quality and speed of FFmpeg's native Vorbis
    encoder by redesigning major components and implementing a new
    psychoacoustic model.

	\begin{itemize}
	\item Built a custom psychacoustical model capable of detecting
              transient signals and dynamically switching encoding modes.
	\item Implemented noise normalization to generate a gaussian noise
	      profile and rewrote residue encoding to minimize quantization
	      error.
	\item Rewrote the stereo coupling to dynamically switch between
	      various lossy and lossless modes.
	\item Added foundational support for arbitrary channel mappings.
	\end{itemize}

    \section{\mysidestyle Other\\Projects}

    \textbf{Autonomous Drone}\\
    Built an autonomous drone from bare components and developed an
    off-machine flight controller.

	\begin{itemize}
	\item Utilized radio communication for transmitting
	      flight directions and data between an embedded linux
	      device and embedded microcontroller.
	\item Implemented custom PID controls to maintain flight stability
	      using on-board sensor data.
	\end{itemize}

    \textbf{Radio Com}\\
    Building an embedded device capable of interfacing with Linux devices and
    Android phones for communicating over radio.

	\begin{itemize}
	\item Utilizing LoRa modulation to communicate over 10km between
	      devices.
	\item Developed an Android application with support for end-to-end
	      encrypted communication.
	\item Writing linux drivers to support online-data requests from
	      USB.
	\end{itemize}


    \textbf{PetroMatch}, Grand Junction, CO \vspace{2mm}\\\vspace{1mm}%
    \textsl{Data Analyst, Backend Developer} \hfill \textbf{Mar 2017}\\
    Worked on a small team to utilize open-source data for oil and gas companies
    to fully utilize geographical, economic, and business license data.

	\begin{itemize}
	\item Built a custom ORDMS for PostGIS information suitable for web and
	      mobile development
	\item Built an internal API for mapping data in different projections and
	      formats
	\end{itemize}
    
    \section{\mysidestyle College\\Education}

    \textbf{Colorado Mesa University}, Grand Junction, CO \vspace{2mm}\\\vspace{1mm}%
    \textsl{B.S., Computer Science} GPA - 4.0 \hfill \textbf{Aug 2014 -- May 2018}\\
    
    \textbf{Colorado School of Mines}, Golden, CO \vspace{2mm}\\\vspace{1mm}%
    \textsl{Chemical Engineering} GPA - 3.83 \hfill \textbf{Aug 2015 -- May 2016}\\
    Received recognition for developing a simulation engine for municipal waste
    reactors that could be embedded within existing data work-flows for energy
    companies and researchers.
