    \section{\mysidestyle Work\\Experience}

    \textbf{FFmpeg} \vspace{2mm}\\\vspace{1mm}%
    \textsl{Google Summer of Code Participant -- Vorbis Encoder} \hfill \textbf{Feb 2017 -- August 2017}\\
    Improved the encoding quality and speed of FFmpeg's native Vorbis
    encoder by redesigning major components and implementing a new
    psychoacoustic model.

	\begin{itemize}
	\item Built a custom psychoacoustical model capable of detecting
              transient signals and dynamically switching encoding modes.
	\item Implemented noise normalization to generate a gaussian noise
	      profile and rewrote residue encoding to minimize quantization
	      error.
	\item Rewrote the stereo coupling to dynamically switch between
	      various lossy and lossless modes.
	\item Added foundational support for arbitrary channel mappings.
	\end{itemize}

    \section{\mysidestyle Other\\Projects}

    \textbf{Project Armoire}\\
    Building a custom homework and test grader for computer science faculty at
    Colorado Mesa University. Students are able to submit assignments and receive
    feedback that mimics a TDD workflow.

	\begin{itemize}
	\item Using docker to enable a safe and scalable infrastructure for code
          compilation and execution.
    \item Designing the backend codebase to suport native desktop and in-browser
          web clients.
	\end{itemize}

    \textbf{Multipong}\\
    Built a real-time multiplayer pong arena game for the web browser using Flask and
    websockets.

        \begin{itemize}
        \item Built a system capable of handling hundreds of concurrent games.
        \item Maintained game-state synchronization between an arbitrary number of
              game servers using Redis and MongoDB.
        \item Implemented custom latency correction logic and anti-cheat mechanisms.
	\end{itemize}


    \textbf{re-mark}\\
    Built a website that allows users to annotate any page on the internet
    and store their own comments.

        \begin{itemize}
        \item Built a REST API in Go for managing user-supplied data in MongoDB.
        \item Utilized xxHash and gzip to cache external pages for users in
              a safe and memory efficient manner.
        \item Integrated Google's OAuth API for user authentication.
        \end{itemize}

    \section{\mysidestyle College\\Education}

    \textbf{Colorado Mesa University}, Grand Junction, CO \vspace{2mm}\\\vspace{1mm}%
    \textsl{B.S., Computer Science} GPA - 4.0 \hfill \textbf{Aug 2014 -- May 2018}

    \textbf{Colorado School of Mines}, Golden, CO \vspace{2mm}\\\vspace{1mm}%
    \textsl{Chemical Engineering} GPA - 3.83 \hfill \textbf{Aug 2015 -- May 2016}\\
    Received recognition for developing a simulation engine for municipal waste
    reactors that could be embedded within existing data work-flows for energy
    companies and researchers.
