    \section{\mysidestyle Work\\Experience}

    \textbf{AMERGINT Technologies} \vspace{1mm}\\\vspace{1mm}%
    \textsl{Development Engineer, Launch/Range Systems} \hfill \textbf{July 2018 -- Present}\\
      Designed, implemented, and tested mission-critical and safety-critical systems written
      in C++ and Python based on customer specifications and requirements.
      \begin{itemize}
      \item Lead the design and development of simulation and hardware-in-the-loop testing platforms
            for active development of prototype defense technologies.
      \item Designed and implemented next-generation software-based LDPC decoders capable of
            multi-gigabit downlink rates.
      \item Optimized the performance of telemetry processing systems by 
            up to 700\% while improving meaningful test coverage and documentation by 35\%.
      \item Designed and implemented the rearchitecture of IRIG 106-compliant
            Chapter 10 data recorders for rapid development of new recorder product lines.
      \item Performed certification and factory acceptance testing of multi-million dollar
            satellite test systems.
      \end{itemize}


    \textbf{FFmpeg} \vspace{1mm}\\\vspace{1mm}%
    \textsl{Google Summer of Code Participant -- Vorbis Encoder} \hfill \textbf{Feb 2017 -- Aug 2017}\\
    Improved the encoding quality and speed of FFmpeg's native Vorbis
    encoder by redesigning major components and implementing a new
    psychoacoustic model.

	\begin{itemize}
	\item Built a custom psychoacoustical model capable of detecting
              transient signals and dynamically switching encoding modes.
	\item Implemented noise normalization to generate a perceived gaussian noise
            profile and designed residue encoding to minimize
            quantization error.
	\item Rewrote the stereo coupling to dynamically switch between
	      various lossy and lossless modes.
	\end{itemize}

    \section{\mysidestyle Other\\Projects}

    \textbf{Flying Drone}\\
    Built an autonomous drone from bare components and a custom real-time operating environment.

    \begin{itemize}
      \item Utilized FHSS with a custom packetized protocol for efficient command and control,
            and telemetry in populated and noisy ISM bands.
      \item Designed kernel drivers to minimize the latency of subsystem components in centralized
            ground stations.
      \item Developed full environment and sensor simulations for faster iteration of closed loop
            controls and vehicle localization algorithms.
    \end{itemize}

    \textbf{Project Armoire}\\
    Built a homework and test platform for students learning to code.

    \begin{itemize}
        \item Utilized Docker and AppArmor to securely execute arbitrary code
              and run unit tests in light-weight sandboxes behind a RESTful API.
        \item Automatically cross-referenced code submissions to detect code-similarity
              and probability of plagiarism based on a corpus of previous assignments.
    \end{itemize}
